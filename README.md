# SeatsArranged-Project-for-HackASol-Hackathon-
My Project also aims to use Augmented Reality to deal with the challenge of social distancing in schools. I have developed three different models which visualizes different seating arrangements which can be used in the classrooms. The first model(modelmain2) is a normal model which cane be adopted in a classroom. The Second model(modelmain1) overcomes the flaws of the first model and the third model(modelmain3) provides the overall best model which can be employed in the classrooms. Through these models, i aim to help address the issue of social distancing which would be a lot importants for students when schools open.
